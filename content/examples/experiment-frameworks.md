VMC was developed by the [ALICE Software Project](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Offline/) and,
since then it was adopted by other experiment frameworks.

#### ALICE

- [AliRoot](http://alice-offline.web.cern.ch) - the ALICE software framework (for LHC Run 1 and 2)
- [O2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2) - the new ALICE software framework in development (for LHC Run 3 and 4)

#### FAIR

- [FairRoot](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot) - A simulation, reconstruction and analysis framework, based on the ROOT system, for FAIR experiments
