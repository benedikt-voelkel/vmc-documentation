# G4Root

<p>The G4Root package is an interface allowing running a GEANT4 simulation with a ROOT geometry. In fact it is just the G4 navigation that uses directly the TGeo geometry. 

<p>
Since Root development version 5.27/xx the G4Root package is distributed in <b>geant4_vmc</b>. In spite of being provided within Geant4 VMC, it can be built and used independently from VMC.
